  - `type` <[string]> Type of the mouse event
  - `x` <[number]> X coordinate of the event relative to the main frame's viewport in CSS pixels
  - `y` <[number]> Y coordinate of the event relative to the main frame's viewport in CSS pixels. 0 refers to
the top of the viewport and Y increases as it proceeds towards the bottom of the viewport
  - `modifiers` <[integer]> Bit field representing pressed modifier keys. Alt=1, Ctrl=2, Meta/Command=4, Shift=8
(default: 0)
  - `timestamp` <TimeSinceEpoch> Time at which the event occurred
  - `button` <[string]> Mouse button (default: "none")

  - `type` <[string]> Type of the touch event. TouchEnd and TouchCancel must not contain any touch points, while
TouchStart and TouchMove must contains at least one
  - `touchPoints` array of <TouchPoint> Active touch points on the touch device. One event per any changed point (compared to
previous touch event in a sequence) is generated, emulating pressing/moving/releasing points
one by one
  - `modifiers` <[integer]> Bit field representing pressed modifier keys. Alt=1, Ctrl=2, Meta/Command=4, Shift=8
(default: 0)
  - `timestamp` <TimeSinceEpoch> Time at which the event occurred

  - `deltaY` <[number]> Y delta in DIP for mouse wheel event (default: 0)
  - `modifiers` <[integer]> Bit field representing pressed modifier keys. Alt=1, Ctrl=2, Meta/Command=4, Shift=8
(default: 0)
  - `clickCount` <[integer]> Number of times the mouse button was clicked (default: 0)

Emulates touch event from the mouse event parameters.

  - `relativeSpeed` <[integer]> Relative pointer speed in pixels per second (default: 800)
  - `gestureSourceType` <GestureSourceType> Which type of input events to be generated (default: 'default', which queries the platform
for the preferred input type)

Synthesizes a pinch gesture over a time period by issuing appropriate touch events.

#### Input.synthesizeScrollGesture()
- parameters
